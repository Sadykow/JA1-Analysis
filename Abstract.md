### Abstract
1) (1sent)In this paper ...
   1) DIFFERENT ml EVALUATED for suitability of SoC Estimation for Li-ion batteries   
2) (1-2sent) Why/application/
   1) 1-2 Why critical to understand and apply and due to emplication of EV it becomes critical to research on. 
3) Method
   1) 5 algs were evaluated againt 3 cycles where cross-validated for SoC. Extrapolated to unseen
   
4) Results. Max & Min error. How well can they work for EV.
5) What was the conclusion or finding that neither
of them is effective and further investigation is required to be sure of safety usage inside a car
   1) Conclussion - All ML models so far were prososed have pross and cons and remains scope to develope an aprroach broadly applicable to SoC.
