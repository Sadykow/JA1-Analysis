	abstract = {State of charge (SOC) estimation is critical to the safe and reliable operation of Li-ion battery packs, which nowadays are becoming increasingly used in electric vehicles (EVs), Hybrid EVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and smart grid systems. We introduce a new method to perform accurate SOC estimation for Li-ion batteries using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM). We showcase the LSTM-RNN's ability to encode dependencies in time and accurately estimate SOC without using any battery models, filters, or inference systems like Kalman filters. In addition, this machine-learning technique, like all others, is capable of generalizing the abstractions it learns during training to other datasets taken under different conditions. Therefore, we exploit this feature by training an LSTM-RNN model over datasets recorded at various ambient temperatures, leading to a single network that can properly estimate SOC at different ambient temperature conditions. The LSTM-RNN achieves a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.573\% at a fixed ambient temperature and an MAE of 1.606\% on a dataset with ambient temperature increasing from 10 to 25 °C.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the state-of-charge of the battery's current cycle is one of the major tasks in the charge management of rechargeable batteries. We propose a long short-term memory model with an attention mechanism to estimate the charging status of two lithium-ion batteries. Data from three dynamic tests such as dynamic stress test, supplemental federal test procedure-driving schedule, and federal urban driving schedule are used to evaluate our model at different temperatures. One dataset or two datasets are used as the training data, and the other datasets are used as the test data. The model achieves the predictive root mean square errors of 0.9593, 0.8714, and 0.9216 at three different temperatures for the FUDS dataset. Moreover, the predictive RMSE of the proposed model is lower than 1.41 for all our experiments. We use the Monte Carlo dropout technique to verify the robust of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Prognostics for lithium-ion batteries is very critical in many industrial applications, and accurate prediction of battery state of health (SOH) is of great importance for health management. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based prognostic method for lithium-ion batteries with on-line validation. An effective variant of recurrent neural network, i.e. long short-term memory structure, is used with variable input dimension, that facilitates network training with additional labeled samples. Adaptive time-series predictions are carried out for prognostics. An on-line validation method is further proposed for parameter optimization in real time based on the available system information, which allows for continuous model improvement. Experiments on a popular lithium-ion battery dataset are implemented to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results show the prognostic performances are promising both for the multi-steps-ahead predictions and long-horizon SOH estimations.},

	abstract = {We propose a hierarchical attention network for document classiﬁcation. Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classiﬁcation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin. Visualization of the attention layers illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative words and sentences.},
