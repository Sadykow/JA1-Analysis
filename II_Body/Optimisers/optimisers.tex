The optimisation algorithm aims to define a way to minimise the difference between model prediction and actual values, using one of the selected Loss functions~\ref{subsub:losses}.
The following section breaks down several methods selected by chosen authors in the growing complexity.
\subsection{Types of optimisers}
The selection of the optimiser defines how fast the model will achieve the local minimum.
Different algorithms utilised several improvements to achieve an optimum result more quickly and avoid overfitting.
All model share the same parameter, the learning rate $\alpha$, which acts as a step to update predictions.
