	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for ﬁrst-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

	title = {{INCORPORATING} {NESTEROV} {MOMENTUM} {INTO} {ADAM}},
	abstract = {This work aims to improve upon the recently proposed and rapidly popularized optimization algorithm Adam (Kingma \& Ba, 2014). Adam has two main components—a momentum component and an adaptive learning rate component. However, regular momentum can be shown conceptually and empirically to be inferior to a similar algorithm known as Nesterov’s accelerated gradient (NAG). We show how to modify Adam’s momentum component to take advantage of insights from NAG, and then we present preliminary evidence suggesting that making this substitution improves the speed of convergence and the quality of the learned models.},
