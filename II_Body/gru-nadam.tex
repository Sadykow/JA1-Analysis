\section{GRU with Nadam optimizer}\label{sec:GRU-nadam}
\subsection{Definition}
    Similar to LSTM, a Gradien Recurrent Unit intended to solve problem of vanishing gradient.
    Unlike Chemali2017 implementation, where training set was consisted of input data sequences with stateles model, BinXio2019 used statefull model within batches and intrduced a technique of optimization to speedup training process.
Implementation of the model based on BinXio or someone else. Introduce their way of implementation how to improve optimisation using 2 algorithms as per their discussion.
