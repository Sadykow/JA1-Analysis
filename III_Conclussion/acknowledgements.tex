The research was undertaken through funding from the Automotive Engineering Graduate Program (AEGP) in cooperation with the Queensland government and Prohelion industry partner.
All models evaluation has been performed through the help of the QUT HDR research and technical staff, who arranged access to the Hight Performance Machine (HPC Lyra) for the extensive initial computations.
The research has been conducted in cooperation with Mr Sam Haines, who performed a similar investigation on a similar dataset using Kalman filters and its' branches.
In addition, both Sam and I owe our progress to our Principal and Associate supervisors, Associate Professors David Holmes and Geoff Walker, who have been following our progress through the entire research.
Finally, we gratefully acknowledge the original developers of the Machine Learning framework Tensorflow from Google, who wrote detailed guides and documentation for all necessary tools used throughout the investigation.
%It is worth acknowledging the input from Dr Olga, Dr Mahsa and Pr Lovell who showed a practical interesr in the research and ... contribtution.
