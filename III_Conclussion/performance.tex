The work offered several implementations of Machine Learning algorithms for State of Charge Estimation over A123 batteries.
The computation of the accuracies, recently summarised in Tables~\ref{tab:acc-results1} and~\ref{tab:acc-results2}, has involved multi-device calculations.
The measurement has been performed over the entire dataset of each profile.
Therefore, a synchronisation strategy has been attempted to speed up the process and keep devices temperature safe.
Fans at 45-50\% duty cycle kept temperatures within 45-52 degrees range.
A small timeout to switch between sample intensive datasets allowed GPUs to cool off between model models.
Figure~\ref{fig:device_compute} demonstrates the paralysation mechanism for a single model, where flops and the total number of parameters are determined using the script in Appendix~\ref{app:flops}.
Since the CPU has the lowest compute rating, it attempted only a single dataset, while 2 GPUs handled between 6-8 sets together.

Since the end goal is to deploy an electric vehicle to run processing online, there have been several attempts to measure performance on a few categories of embedded devices.
By itself, Stateful models are not supported by TFLite.
Thus, a single attempt to make a Custom Stateful stateless model test is time inefficient, and those seemed unreasonable.
Instead, six models were broke down into five foundation implementations and performance profiled, Table~\ref{tab:speed}.
Calculation of accuracies performed with 20 attempts average and offset calculation with mean of the difference between maximum and minimum.
As a result, Coral TPU has an advantage over Raspberrypi since the core is dedicated to run tensor computations, despite Pi's latest hardware release.
The android selection only proved how time-consuming usage of ML model on relatively old CPU could be, but in a proper synchronised manner and without rapid consumption, such devices still have their usage in such application.
% Steady Voltage consumption over USB Port stable around 5.03V for all devices. Coral TPU steady current - 0.07A. Keep those details for the Ch5 if asked.
