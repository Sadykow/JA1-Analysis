% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting.

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{
	% State of Charge (SoC) estimation is a crucial property of a Lithium-Ion battery in any electrical system.
	% An accurate charge percentage, without any discrepancies, allows a battery management system (BMS) to enhance battery module utilisation further, allowing higher endurance or prolonging overall utilisation for more cycles.
	% There have been numerous attempts to determine SoC without physical intervention, such as battery modelling.
	% Since batteries commonly have non-linear characteristics, statistical-based Machine Learning methods have the potential to replace the traditional model.
	The present paper conducts a practical usability investigation on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to determine the best-suited machine learning method for Electric vehicles (EV).
	Through the implementation of models from multiple published sources and cross-validation testing with several driving scenarios of Lithium-Ion batteries, several models have been assessed on accuracy and drawbacks.% against simulations of different driving conditions.
	% \begin{itemize}
	%     \item Five models were selected from various published State of Charge estimation models based on cell types (GRU and LSTM with Attention) and optimisers (SGD, Adam, Nadam, AdaMax and Robust Adam).
	%     \item Five models were selected from various published State of Charge estimation models based on cell types of GRU or LSTM and optimisers like Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, Nadam, AdaMax and Robust Adam, with extensions via Momentum calculus or Attention layer.
	% \end{itemize}
	Five models were selected from various published State of Charge estimation models based on cell types of GRU or LSTM and optimisers like Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, Nadam, AdaMax and Robust Adam, with extensions via Momentum calculus or Attention layer.
	Each method will be examined by applying training techniques like a learning rate scheduler or rollback recovery to speed up fitting, highlighting implementation specifics, and all of that using the TensorFlow framework as close as possible to the published sources on openly available battery data.
	The results highlight the percentage accuracy in the average of 3.64\% of Root Mean Squared Error, several drawbacks of the overall implementation, and propose potential solutions for further improvement.
	Every implemented model had a similar drawback of poor capturing of the middle area of a charge, applying higher weight on a voltage rather than current.
	The combined techniques in a single custom model could be better suited to improve accuracy further.
