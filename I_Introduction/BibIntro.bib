  abstract={This paper deploys electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the impact of temperature and dc bias current on battery impedance characteristics. Measured test results are used to demonstrate that, under conditions where the nonlinear Butler-Volmer equation is necessary to model the electrode charge transfer characteristics, the semicircular trajectory that typically appears in the EIS results shrinks in diameter as the battery's dc bias current increases. For a lithium-based battery, the nonlinearity introduced by the Butler-Volmer relationship is more pronounced at low temperature, while lead-acid batteries typically exhibit this nonlinearity even at room temperature. The impact of dc bias current on the battery model and EIS characteristics are thoroughly investigated using a combination of experimental tests combined with theoretical justification based on the Arrhenius equation. The value of using this observed relationship to improve the accuracy of battery models and condition monitors (e.g., state-of charge, etc.) is discussed in the paper.},

	abstract = {Energy storage system (ESS) technology is still the logjam for the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have attracted considerable attention in the EV industry owing to their high energy density, lifespan, nominal voltage, power density, and cost. In EVs, a smart battery management system (BMS) is one of the essential components; it not only measures the states of battery accurately, but also ensures safe operation and prolongs the battery life. The accurate estimation of the state of charge (SOC) of a Li-ion battery is a very challenging task because the Li-ion battery is a highly time variant, non-linear, and complex electrochemical system. This paper explains the workings of a Li-ion battery, provides the main features of a smart BMS, and comprehensively reviews its SOC estimation methods. These SOC estimation methods have been classified into four main categories depending on their nature. A critical explanation, including their merits, limitations, and their estimation errors from other studies, is provided. Some recommendations depending on the development of technology are suggested to improve the online estimation.},

    abstract = { Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. }

    ABSTRACT = {State of Charge (SoC) estimation is one of the most significant and difficult techniques to promote the commercialization of electric vehicles (EVs). Suffering from various interference in vehicle driving environment and model uncertainties due to the strong time-variant property and inconsistency of batteries, the existing typical SoC estimators such as coulomb counting and extended Kalman filter cannot perform their theoretically optimal efficacy in practical applications. Aiming at enhancing the robustness of SoC estimation and improving accuracy under the real driving conditions with noises and uncertainties, this paper proposes a framework consisting of (1) an adaptive-κ nonlinear diffusion filter to reduce the noise in current measurement, (2) a self-learning strategy to estimate and remove the zero-drift, (3) a coulomb counting algorithm to realize open-loop SoC estimation, (4) an H∞ filter to implement closed-loop robust estimation, and (5) a data fusion unite to achieve the final estimation by integrating the advantages of the two SoC estimators. The availability and efficacy of each component have been demonstrated based on comparative studiesin simulation with the conventional approaches respectively, under the testing conditions of noises with various signal-noise-ratios, varying zero-drifts, and different model errors. The overall framework has also been verified to rationally and efficiently combine these components and achieve robust estimation results in the presence of kinds of noises and uncertainties.},

The learning system tunes the Coulomb metric method in such a way that the estimation process remains error free from the time-dependent variation. The proposed learning system uses the fuzzy logic, which is not used for estimation of SOC but perform as a component of learning system. The fuzzy logic is used as a soft computing device for a multi-variables function evolution. During learning process the system automatically generates a new fuzzy rule base, and replaces the old fuzzy rule base.
