### Abstract
1) (1sent) In this paper
   1) Different MLs evaluated for suitability of SoC Estimation for Li-ion batteries   
2) (1-2sent) Why/application/
   1-2 It is critical to understand and apply, and due to the implication of EV, it becomes critical to research. 
3) Method
   1) 5 algs were evaluated againt 3 cycles where cross-validated for SoC. Extrapolated to unseen
   
4) Results. Max & Min error. How well can they work for EV.
5) What was the conclusion or finding that neither
of them is effective and further investigation is required to be sure of safety usage inside a car
   Conclusion - All ML models so far were proposed have pros and cons and remain scope to develop an approach broadly applicable to SoC.
